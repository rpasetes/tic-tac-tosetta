# React + Vite

WRITER'S NOTES: Did this implementation with Michael Chung (W1'24), using the [React.dev tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). Documentation below was generated by Vite by running ```npm create vite@latest```, used it for a lightweight dev environment and user-friendly features (primarily hot-loading).

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
